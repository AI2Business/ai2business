## Runing a small timeseries forecast

Before running a time series forecast, the initial data set has to be generated first via oneliner. The online `four_step_search` combines four types of trend search:

1. Overtime
2. By regions
3. By related topics
4. By related queries

However, this example is only focusing on the dateframe from *Overtime*.

Hence, search trend for the years "2017", "2018", "2019", and "2020" will be generated and plotted.

### Note

A dependency between the years is obviously given, even if single event trigger breakouts.

And the Pearson-correlation shows the negative linear dependency between the current and previous year.
